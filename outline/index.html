         The home atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands on instruction, with personal interaction.The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands on instruction, with personal interaction. With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents. We also refrain from burning incense. We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class please be on time to respect the sacred place of others. The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you are actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy.There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room—any contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking through the studio. Please bring only your mat, towel and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose as a distraction.</p>

        <P>
         It happens every spring.</P>
         <p> This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 28, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm.</p> 
            <P> It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love.</P> 
          <P> Even for those that stay active through the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints. 
        </P>

         We’re having a Clothing Swap at the studio on Saturday, April 16, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. Bring us your worn but still awesome cloths and in exchange take home a new spring wardrobe!  This of course extends to shoes, jewelry, books... (then stay and check out the new class ;)</p>
         <p>The clothing swaps are a great community event!  Come and chat with those faces you see in classes, but maybe have never talked to.</p> 
         <p>It it's a nice day we can hang out on the roof and have tea!  If you don't have anything to exchange, come and sift through the piles and take home some treasures.</p> 
         <p> If you can't stay feel free to drop things off.</p>
         <p>Everything left over will get donated!</p>

         The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift from posture to posture.  The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more advanced.  We support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with the ability to slow down and stay present.  Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports healing physically, emotionally and spiritually
